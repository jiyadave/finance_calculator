# Finance Calculator

*  For my first Capstone project, I have created a finance calculator.🧮

*  This allows the user to calculate the amount of interest they will earn on an investment.💷

* Or the amount they will have to repay on a home loan.🏡

## 🚀 About Me

I'm an aspiring software developer.


I self-taught myself Photoshop and Illustrator; followed by Excel.


This then paved the way for Python and SQL, and this is just the beginning.
